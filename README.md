**📦 Supply Chain Analysis – Power BI**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project analyzes the Supply Chain dataset (Sample data) (24 columns, 100 rows) containing details about product sales, manufacturing, logistics, and supplier performance.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights and recommendations to optimize supply chain operations and improve profitability.

**📊 Data Attributes**
Key attributes in the dataset include:
  - Product Info → Product Type, SKU, Price, Availability, Revenue Generated
  - Customer Data → Demographics, Order Quantities
  - Inventory → Stock Levels, Lead Times
  - Logistics → Shipping Times, Carriers, Costs, Transportation Modes
  - Manufacturing → Production Volumes, Lead Times, Costs, Inspection Results, Defect Rates
  - Suppliers → Supplier Name, Location

**🔄 Process**
- Data Fetching – Extracted dataset from phpMyAdmin (MySQL)
- Data Preparation – Cleaned & validated using Power Query + Python (to ensure no blanks/duplicates)
- Data Visualization – Designed interactive dashboard in Power BI with:
- Sales Analysis
    Operational Analysis
    Shipping Analysis
    KPI Tracking

**📈 Insights**
1) Product Performance
    Skincare is most profitable, followed by Haircare and Cosmetics
    Skincare also has highest demand but higher manufacturing costs
2) Logistics
    Sea transport is the most economical shipping mode
    Route B incurs the highest shipping costs → optimization needed
3) Regional Trends
    Top-performing locations: Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai
    Bangalore shows the lowest sales volumes
4) Manufacturing & Quality
    Skincare manufacturing cost is higher than other categories
    Variations in defect rates highlight need for stronger QC
5) Customer Demographics
    “Unknown” customer group purchased the most across categories
    Skincare is the most popular category overall

**📌 Key Metrics (Summary)****
    Total Revenue: 577.6K
    Average Manufacturing Cost: 47.27
    Average Selling Price: 49.46

**💡 Recommendations**

✔ Optimize costly shipping routes (esp. Route B)
✔ Enhance quality checks for skincare products
✔ Replicate best-performing inventory strategies across product lines
✔ Explore pricing adjustments to boost profit margins
✔ Target marketing efforts toward top-performing demographics
